Cocos2DX-ParticleSystemOpacity
==============================

A Cocos2DX project demonstrating a method of setting a global opacity on a particle system. The particle system is first rendered to a texture which is then used on another sprite node. The opacity can be set on this sprite node modifying the entire particle systems opacity without modifying the particle systems overall appearance.
